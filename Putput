These API calls are well documented and used on your behalf when using our Admin Control Panel, for example.\nAPI calls are protected by default with Session based Authentication, meaning this token will change after 30 days, unless to go through the login process.\nIf you would like to make use of the REST API outside of the Admin Control Panel, you will need to generate a Permanent Token. You can then use this token on your own backend systems etc. You can find more about Pricing and rate limits on our website.\nWe maintain versioned documentation with each release. The API may be updated, for bug fixes, or released under a new version as new features are added.\nThe API endpoint is https://api.siperb.com/\nPostman templates will be released here.
